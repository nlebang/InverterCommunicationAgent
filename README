Assuming the current code is at $HOME/Code/InverterCommunicationAgent
1.	Get OP-TEE and keep it at $HOME. Build OP-TEE by following the build instructions.
2.	After building OP-TEE, enable folder sharing by editing $HOME/devel/optee/build/common.mk.
	Look for the following, and set them as shown:
		QEMU_VIRTFS_ENABLE		?= n
		QEMU_VIRTFS_HOST_DIR	?= $(ROOT)
3.	Get libmodbus from git, and keep it one level up at $HOME/Code/libmodbus-master.
4. 	Run build.sh from $HOME/Code/InverterCommunicationAgent.
5. 	Go to $HOME/devel/optee/build
6. 	Run `make all run`
7. 	After things settle down in the terminal(not xterm), press c in the terminal(not xterm) to start OP-TEE
8. 	In the normal world xterm window, do the following:
		ifconfig lo up
		mount_shared /tmp
		tee-supplicant &
9. 	Execute the following to copy yhe necessary files and run the client and the server
		sh /tmp/myPrograms/output/run.sh
	In case the client and server do not execute properly, then run the client and server manually as:
		server &
		client
	When running manually, it should be noted that the client and server can take a single parameter which denotes the malicious-ness as follows:
		Client malicious=> 1
			server 1 &
			client 1
		Server malicious=> 2
			server 2 &
			client 2
		Client and Server both malicious=> 3
			server 3 &
			client 3
	To redirect the output use something as follows:
		server > serverOutputFile 2>/dev/null &
